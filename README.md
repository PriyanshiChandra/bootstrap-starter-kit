# Bootstrap Starter Pack

This is a starter pack I created. It will help you get started with creating websites using Bootsrap. Clone this repo and feel free to use it to create websites or use in hackathons or edit it.

## How do I use it?

Clone this repo or download it as zip file to your local machine. Downloading as zip file will require unzip on your computer. You can then open the folder in any code editor VS Code, Sublime Text etc.

There are some example files in this repo. You can edit them as and when needed.
